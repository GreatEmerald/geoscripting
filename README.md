Files for the geoscripting university course

Note that I am using RKWard instead of RStudio, and openSUSE instead of OSGeo-Live.
In addition, my preffered directory structure and coding standards are slightly different than what is given in the course description.

I will always use `=` for assigning instead of `<-`, and curly braces will always be on their own lines. The directory for R functions will 
be called "src" for source.

To open the projects in RStudio, import the `.RData` file (or use RKWard and open the `.rkworkspace` file).
