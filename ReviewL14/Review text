Goodmorning,

After changing the directory three times in your script it ran smoothly. 
It created the shapefile you intended and the result I got can be seen in the added image.
Job well done.

An easy to improve feature would be to only let me change the directory once:
import os
os.chdir('/home/user/python')

The following parts can then be written as:
output_file = '/twitter1.csv' 
with open('/twitter1.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:
w.save('/twitter1.shp')

You could add some more comments explaining what part does what, and remove the comments that were already in the exercise of lesson14.
" #do it yourself: enter code her to pull out coordinate  " 

Cheers!
